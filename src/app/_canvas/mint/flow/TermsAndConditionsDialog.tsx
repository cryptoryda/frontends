              <h2>About Canvas</h2>
              <p>
                Canvas is a unique space for you to display your on-chain credentials, status and achievements issued and collected across the Scroll
                ecosystem. It highlights your presence on Scroll by offering a platform to exhibit unique, on-chain badges that signify achievements
                and traits, verified through the Ethereum Attestation Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users will be able to mint a non-transferrable and unique space with Canvas, where they are able to display Badges (defined below).
              </p>
              <p>
                Projects in our ecosystem may from time to time issue badges, which may provide users with additional functionalities on their
                respective platforms (“<b>Badges</b>”). These Badges are minted by projects on the Scroll ecosystem, or Scroll itself.
              </p>
              <p>Canvas also operates a referral rewards mechanism, which is elaborated on in Clause 5.</p>
              <p>You confirm that you have read and understood this Section on Canvas and its purpose.</p>
